# RoboticQA Test Automation Plan

## Mode: Agent

## Step 1: Immediate Analysis & Test Creation

1. Open RoboticQA in your browser
2. Logout if you are already logged in
3. Quickly scan for 5–7 critical test scenarios (prioritize visible elements)
4. Create both positive and negative test cases for each significant feature
5. Make sure you logout of the application before proceeding if logout is present
6. Before starting every test execution, ensure you are logged out of the application

**Focus Areas:**

- Visible UI elements
- Core functionality
- User workflows
- Form validations
- Navigation

## Step 2: Instant Execution & Validation

1. Before creating actual spec file, execute identified scenarios using Playwright MCP
2. Verify all tests pass in the first run
3. For any failures:
   - Fix assertions or selectors
   - Rerun until all tests pass
   - Repeat the fix-and-rerun process until a 100% pass rate is achieved
   - Before starting every test execution, ensure you are logged out of the application

** Validation Criteria: **

- 100% pass rate
- Accurate selectors
- Proper assertions

## Step 3: Rapid Test Implementation

1. Generate a single roboticqa.spec.ts file in the tests folder with all tests
2. Keep tests simple and direct
3. Focus on Chromium only
4. Include essential assertions for each test

**Implementation Guidelines**

```typescript
// Example test structure
test("should verify homepage title", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("http://roboticqa.com/");
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle("Expected Title");
});
```
